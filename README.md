Welcome to the Homebrew-OpenBLAS-Binary-Packages!

I built the binary package from this:

https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS | http://www.openblas.net/

There are two editions.
- build with Visual Studio Enterprise 2017, Release x64 (v0.x.x.zip)
- build with MinGW MSYS (v0.x.x_mingw.zip).

Note: the v0.x.x_mingw.zip is complete package including (BLAS CBLAS LAPACK LAPACKE).
